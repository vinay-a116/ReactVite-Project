# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: "latest",
    sourceType: "module",
    project: ["./tsconfig.json", "./tsconfig.node.json"],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
};
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list

# React App

## Quickstart

```bash
#install create-react-app if you don't already have üßê
npm i -g create-react-app

#to bootstrap a project using this template
npx create-react-app <Your-Project-Name> --template file:./cra-template-ihis
```

## Preamble

As Single-Page applications (SPA) gains widespread adoption in the industry, IHiS SoftwarE Engrg & Development Depart (SEED) has decided to engage Tech Radar team to develop a starter-kit to accelerate development of Frontend projects.

React is the frontend framework of choice, however, React is an unopinionated framework which gives a lot of flexibility to do things your own way, Tech Radar has discussed within Frontend community to bring you a list of opinionated tools.

We have scoured and compiled a list of opinionated tools to help you get started with React.

**Packages included**:

- [Antd](https://ant.design/) - Component Library
- [i18n](https://www.i18next.com/) - Internationalization Support
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) - Http Client
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - SPA Routing
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) - Opinionated Redux library
- [Redux Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/) - Redux side effect manager
- [Redux Persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist) - Redux store persistence and rehydration library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - CSS in JS helper library

## Goals of this template

Improved Developer Experience (DevEx) with consistent project structure and code base across projects in SEED.

## Getting started

### Development environment

This template has been tested and developed on a M1 MacBook Pro, that being said, \*nix based OSes should work fine, for Windows environment, we need help in testing and please report
[issues](https://dev.azure.com/IHIS-HIP/TechRadar/_workitems/create/Bug).

#### üí° Ansible playbook (Optional) - _For standardized development environment_

Tech Radar had also released an Ansible [playbook](https://github.com/murugaratham/ansible-dev-pc).
Do check it out if you want to have a consistent development environment and experience.

#### üí° Eslint (Recommended)

> Skip this section if you have used our [playbook](https://github.com/murugaratham/ansible-dev-pc) to set up your environment.
> If you have not used our playbook, please ensure to accept recommendation by VS Code to install
> [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode).
>
> Check that your VSCode settings have the following configurations.
>
> ```bash
> "editor.formatOnSave": true,
> "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
> ```

#### üí° Husky - git hooks (Recommended)

From our observations, we have found that git hooks are a great way to ensure your code is consistent across the team.

We have included `pre-commit` and `commit-msg` git hooks in our template which will run `lint-staged`, which in turns run `eslint`.

</details>

We highly recommend using [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/#/) in conjunction with [Conventional Changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) to enforce commit message conventions.
We have included husky set-up script in package.json, run the following to get started.

### How to set up husky

- Set up husky environment `npm run prepare` (this will install husky and set up hooks in `.husky/`)
  - Configuring pre-commit hook
  - `npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npx --no-install lint-staged"`
  - üí° _Hint: You can consider to run unit test on pre-commit if it suits your dev workflow_
- Configuring commitlint hook
  - `npx husky add .husky/commit-msg "npx --no-install commitlint --edit"`
  - For more info on commitlint [rules](https://commitlint.js.org/#/reference-rules), look the included `.commitlintrc`

## Included Sample To Do Backend

Assuming that, you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed.

```bash
# if you are on windows, please install wsl2 for bash here --> https://lmgtfy.app/?q=how+to+install+wsl2
# We included a self-contained to do backend Api in docker
./start-backend.sh
```

Once the container is started, go to http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html

# Frontend

```bash
#install create-react-app if you don't already have üßê
npm i -g create-react-app

#to bootstrap a project using this template
npx create-react-app <Your-Project-Name> --template file:./cra-template-ihis
```

A sample set of OpenApi is placed as part of the template. To test out the code generation feature, delete
`lib/util/api/code-gen` and run `npm run api-generation`, you should observe that the integration code is generated
for you.

# FAQ

- üö´ npm audit warning
  - ```bash
    found 29 vulnerabilities (9 moderate, 19 high, 1 critical)
      run `npm audit fix` to fix them, or `npm audit` for details
    ```
  - false positive as explained in this github [issue](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/11174#issuecomment-955712789)
  - But do stay vigilant and report to the right [party](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/main/SECURITY.md) and inform Tech Radar team
